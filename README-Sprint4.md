Project - Sprint 4

Due: Monday, April 22, at 11:00am
Be prepared to demo your project in class on the due date.

Sprint 4 Goal: Complete all backlog items. Change all time to regular time. Refactor code to use Observer design pattern.

Sprint 4 :
-      Finish all current backlog items

-      Change all time units to hours, minutes, seconds. 
       o      Assume truck with travel 30 miles an hour. 
       o      Assume that locations are 0.03 miles apart.
       o      The values for these assumptions should be easy to change.

-      refactor code so that you apply the Observer design pattern to your solution. Your GUI display is one observer. If you have not already done so, create another observer that will print the truck location to standard output as it changes. The subject of the observers is the truck location.  Your code should be able to easily handle the creation of more than one truck.
